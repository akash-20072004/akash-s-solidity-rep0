Project Title: Create a Token
Description: We are going to create a token using the programming language Solidity in which we are first creating a contract followed by public variables.
Then we are going to mapp the address with a totalsupply variable which has been distinguished before,This would be used to map the balances.
Then we are going to create a mint function to mint our token where we would pass the address and values as parameters.
Then we are going to burn the function using a burn function.
Getting Started:
Installing:
1. We can run this code on remix.ethereum.org.
2.Then we are goiung to create a new file naming it with a .sol extension.This can be done using the file explorer option on top left hand side in our remix ethereum application and creating a new file/folder.
3.Then we are going to click on Solidity compiler to compile our code and to run it.
4.We also have to deploy the code by clicking on the option deploy and run transaction to deploy our tokens and also to burn them.
